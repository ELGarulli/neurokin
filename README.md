# neurokin

A Python package to support analysis of neural and kinematic data. 
neurokin supports open_ephys and TDT formats natively for neural and .c3d files for kinematics data but can be expanded easily. Please get in touch if you have another type of data.

The general idea is to make importing and processing neural and kinematics data easier. 
Please refer to the DEMO files for examples on how to process raw neural data (e.g. to observe averaged SEPs) or how to correlate neural and kinematics data.
The examples are not extensive docs, if you feel any of this could be useful please get in touch I'd be happy to show more functionalities or develop a new one.

Here is an example of data processing output for a stimulation protocol.

Here instead an ugly neural recording, just to showcase the kinematics and neural correlation, and the gait cycle parsing.
